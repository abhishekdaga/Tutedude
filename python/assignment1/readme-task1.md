- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The results of each operation are then displayed on the screen.

## Operations Performed
Given two numbers:
- **Addition** → `first_number + second_number`
- **Subtraction** → `first_number - second_number`
- **Multiplication** → `first_number * second_number`
- **Division** → `first_number / second_number`

1. The user is prompted to enter the **first number**.
2. The user is prompted to enter the **second number**.
3. The program calculates:
   - Sum
   - Difference
   - Product
